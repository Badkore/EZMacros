README


Contains a plethora of code to automate the EQ EMU EZ Server.    Code is not perfect and could certainly be refactored, but it worked for me very well while playing EZ for 8 years.




Key macros


autoattack.mac   -  Used to drive a large group for full automated attack.  Uses various loops combined with counters to cast the right spells/perform the right actions 
at the right time.    Uses EQBC chat groups such as ua etc. 

autoheal, autoheal2, autoheal3  -  used for clerics.   With 3 clerics these will create a nice Vie/Heal rotation.    Assign to a hotkey and start at the beginning of fight.  /bct cleric //macro autoheal
these also cast dmg spells.

chanter.mac  -  used for buffing your raid with chanter buffs.   My chanter was on a necro account so I /switchchar at the end.

combat.inc   -  contains various combat methods.   Used in many of the macros. 

corpse.mac   -  loot your corpse   useful to use in combination with aoe rez  /bca //macro corpse.mac

druidheal - 4   used for druid healing.   With 4 druids will do a Skin rotation plus sweet heals
also automates dmg spells.   Very good dps from droods!

EZCharmUpgrade.inc   -  This was my original include file.   I was lazy and grouped many different types of methods here.   They have since been separated out into combat.inc, loot.inc, etc.
some macros still do use this though. 

farmsharp.mac  -  used for farming sharp.   place your toons to the right of sharp in the open space where you will not get aggro.   Checks for sharp and pulls him.
used in conjunction with my jumping through hoops macros lol

gods.mac  -  used for farming T3/T4 bosses.   Requires a toon with the tokens in front of the boss spawner

justpull.mac  -  loops and pulls everything in range using scepter

lootgo - lootgo3.mac   used for automated looting.   These use LoadIni files found in loot.inc or EZCharmUpgrade.inc.   You can set what to loot in those methods.   
Useful if you have toons that want to loot different items, i.e T8 dragon scales. 

lootdestroy.mac  -  will loot and keep what is set to keep while destroying everything else.   Really useful for T9 zone pulls.   Setup 6-8 toons looting and they will tear
through your corpse pile.    Use only in T9.

magenuke.inc   -  Script to automate mages spells.   

movement.inc   Contains movement utilities for max automation!!!

MoveUtility.inc  Contains movement utilities for max automation!!!

necro.mac - necro4.mac   Used for necros to continuously cast Death and other dmg spells.   Using on 4-5 necros will stagger the death spells to allow for max dps

palbuff.mac  -  Will cast all paladin buffs.
